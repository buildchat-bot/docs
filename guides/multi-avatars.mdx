title: Dynamic avatars
---

You can decide to change the host avatar dynamically so that your bot can display multiple avatars.

For this, head over to the "Theme" tab and set the host avatar to a custom variable.

Then you can set this variable to any URL in your flow so that the host avatar changes dynamically.

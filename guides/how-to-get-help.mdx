Here is what you should do if you have an issue or even a question (this list is ordered from fastest to slowest resolution time):

1. Read this documentation. Use the search bar to find what you are looking for.
2. Users subscribed to the `Paid` plan can directly reach out through the chat widget in the bottom right corner of the app.
3. Email us at support@buildchat.bot

## If this is urgent

An urgent request is something that is causing a major issue for you or your business in relation to Chatbot in production.

If that is the case, report it to ivan@buildchat.bot.

There are several ways users can interact with a Chatbot workspace:

- Admins: admins who can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage other admins, members, and guests.

- Members: People on your team who can create and edit chatbots, but not edit settings or add members.

- Guests: People external to your team who you want to work with on specific chatbots. They can be invited to individual chatbots, but not an entire workspace. They can't be given workspace-wide access. They must be invited to individual chatbots to view them.

## How to invite admins and members

In your workspace, click on the **Settings & Members** button and then the **Members** tab.

You will see your Workspace members list.

There you can invite new admins or members and set existing members as admins.

## How to invite guests

In your chatbot, click on the **Invite users to collaborate** icon button.

You will see the guests list and who has access to this particular chatbot.

Guests can either:

- View the chatbot: they will be able to view the flow and the results but they will not be able to modify the flow.

- Edit the chatbot: they will be able to view **AND** edit the flow and the results

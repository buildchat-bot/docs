The Website input block allows you to ask your user for a URL. It will check if it is properly formatted.

The retry message will be displayed whenever Typebot detected that the email is not properly formatted.

It won't check if the email address is **valid**. To do that, you will have to trigger a [Webhook block](/editor/blocks/integrations/webhook) and call an email validation service API.

The Rating input block allows you to ask your user for a rating.

The rating input is very customizable, you can set a custom range, numbers or a custom icon, and bottom labels.

## NPS

You could for example configure it so that it collects the Net promoter score.

## Custom icon

To insert a custom icon, you'll need to insert SVG content. It should start with `<svg>` and end with `</svg>`. You can find great open-source icons on [Feather](https://feathericons.com/)
